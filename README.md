**SQL Techniques for Data Wrangling and Cleaning**

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase various SQL techniques utilized for data wrangling and cleaning in projects I have executed. This repository aims to provide insights into effective data manipulation using SQL queries for diverse data sets.

**Overview**

**SQL Data Wrangling**: Explore a collection of SQL queries demonstrating data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation techniques employed in real-world projects.
**Workflow**
**1. Data Collection**: Initially, data sets from various sources were acquired and stored in a structured format within a SQL database.

**2. SQL Data Manipulation**: Utilizing SQL queries, I implemented several techniques for data wrangling, ensuring data quality, consistency, and reliability. Techniques include:

Data cleansing: Identifying and rectifying inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.

Data transformation: Formatting data, handling duplicates, and restructuring for analysis.

Data enrichment: Combining datasets, creating new features, or deriving additional insights.

**3. Python Analysis**: The outcomes of the SQL data wrangling activities were further analyzed using Python. Python's diverse libraries for data analysis and statistical operations were employed to derive meaningful insights and perform advanced analytics.

**4. Visualization with Tableau**: The processed and analyzed data were visualized using Tableau, allowing for interactive and comprehensive representations. The visualizations created in Tableau provide intuitive insights derived from the cleaned and analyzed datasets.
